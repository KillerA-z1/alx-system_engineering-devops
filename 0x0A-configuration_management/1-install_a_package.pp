# Puppet manifest to install the Flask package.
# This manifest uses Puppet's package resource type to ensure that the Flask package is installed.

# The package resource specifies the package name as 'python3.8', the desired version as '3.8.10',
# and the provider as 'pip3'. This means that Puppet will use the 'pip3' package provider to
# install the 'python3.8' package with version '3.8.10'.

package { 'python3.8':
    ensure   => '3.8.10',
    provider => 'pip3',
}

# The package resource specifies the package name as 'flask', the desired version as '2.1.0',
# and the provider as 'pip3'. This means that Puppet will use the 'pip3' package provider to
# install the 'flask' package with version '2.1.0'.

package { 'flask':
    ensure   => '2.1.0',
    provider => 'pip3',
}

# The package resource specifies the package name as 'werkzeug', the desired version as '2.1.1',
# and the provider as 'pip3'. This means that Puppet will use the 'pip3' package provider to
# install the 'werkzeug' package with version '2.1.1'.
