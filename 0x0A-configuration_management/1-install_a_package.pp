# Puppet manifest to install the Flask package.
# This manifest uses Puppet's package resource type to ensure that the Flask package is installed.
# The package resource specifies the package name as 'flask', the desired version as '2.1.0',
# and the provider as 'pip3'. This means that Puppet will use the 'pip3' package provider to
# install the 'flask' package with version '2.1.0'.
package { 'flask':
    ensure   => '2.1.0',
    provider => 'pip3',
}
